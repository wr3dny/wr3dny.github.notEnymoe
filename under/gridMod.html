            <p>
                After over ten years of work as civil engineer designer, I decided it's time to move on and start new
                career path.
                During the years of my work I have learned to execute projects:</p>
            <p>
                - as part of team, where my role was to coordinate project scope with other branches of industries and
                designate particular parts of the project for each member of my team,
            </p>
            <p>
                - as an individual “unit” where I was responsible for project from the scratch to final version
                (collaborating with other branches).
            </p>
            <p>
                Both abovementioned ways often required work under pressure of time and making decisions about keeping
                balance between security and economy.
